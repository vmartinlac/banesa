Banesa stands for BAyesian NEtwork SAmpler.

This is a library allowing to represent a bayesian network and to sample from it. The samples are saved to an SQLite database whose schema is created automatically.
The user just has to define the structure of the graph and the sampling functions of each node.

The purpose of this library is to ease validation campaigns of signal processing or computer vision algorithms.
